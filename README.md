## Image-Level Labels for AICD Dataset
### Dataset
Since the AICD dataset is no longer available on the original website, I uploaded it to google drive. <br>
You can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1anlZYIDaZfnFvijg8SfYqt7CvyMDhR_E/view?usp=sharing). <br>

The dataset is also available on kaggle, see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/aerial-change-detection-in-video-games). <br>

### Labels
You can find the image-level labels in the folder `AICD_image_level_labels`. The file `classes.csv` contains the class IDs and a description for each class. The file `image_level_labels.csv` associates each image (defined by *view* and *scene*) with a class.
